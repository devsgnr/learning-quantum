# Learning Quantum using IBM Qiskit
Following the IBM Qiskit Textbook for learning Quantum Computing - this is just a record for me to have a place to consult for solutions before I reacg out to StackOverflow or Qiskit Slack.

List of lessons I have covered:
- Basic Quantum Circuits
- Superposition & Entangling States
- Parameterized Quantum Circuits
- Data Encoding
- Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits

Currently
- Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits (In Practice)

### __Get Started__
To get started with the source and notebooks, follow the following steps
1. After cloning this repository; create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` and doing so activate the enivornment using; 
   
   On MacOS & Unix, run:
   ```bash
   source ./<env_name>/bin/activate
   ```
   
   On Windows, run:
   ```bash
   <env_name>\bin\activate.bat
   ```
   

2. Install all the neccesary pip packages from the `requirements.txt` file using;
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

--------
The Jupyter Notebook(s) should detect your kernel and you can run the cells within the notebook(s) and see the ouputs. (I'm using VS Code)
