# Learning Quantum using IBM Qiskit
Following the IBM Qiskit Textbook for learning Quantum Computing - this is just a record for me to have a place to consult for solutions before I reacg out to StackOverflow or Qiskit Slack.

List of lessons I have covered:
- Basic Quantum Circuits
- Superposition & Entangling States
- Parameterized Quantum Circuits
- Data Encoding

Currently
- Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits
